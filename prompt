write me a program/bot that has a basic ui. i want this bot to act as a travel inspiration. it will ask the user four questions. the first question is: where they want to go. the second question is: how long they want to go to that specific place. the third question is what activities they like to do when they travel. the fourth question is 'anything else?'. the bot will then product a travel itinerary outline for the user that they can export and edit themselves
